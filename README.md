# JPG to ASCII Text Image Converter (GoLang)

This project converts a JPG image into an ASCII text image and saves the result in a `txt` file. The conversion process involves mapping the image pixels to ASCII characters based on their intensity.

## How It Works

1. Place any JPG image in the root directory of this project.
2. Rename the image to `img.jpg`.
3. Build and run the `main.go` file.
4. The ASCII image will be generated and saved in `data.txt`.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Go (Golang) installed on your machine.

### Steps

1. **Place the Image:**

   Ensure your image is in the root directory and renamed to `img.jpg`.

2. **Build the Go Program:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to build the Go program:

   ```sh
   go build main.go
3. **Run the Program::**

   After building the program, execute the following command to run it:

   ```sh
   ./main

## Voila!
After running the program, the ASCII image will be generated and saved in `data.txt` in the root directory.
